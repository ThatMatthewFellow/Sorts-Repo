# Sorts - ThatMatthewFellow

These are a bunch of sorts that I've seen throughout my time using C++.

There are four types of sorts in these files:
1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort

Each of which function with different efficiencies and use different functions to aid them
